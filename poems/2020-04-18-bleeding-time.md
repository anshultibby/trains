# Bleeding time  
Yesterday i was an hourglass of sand  
The sky to paint  
while I stood  
in Pain,  
Time  
Glistening   
Through my skin  
Within: making small, soft cuts   
With its lazy, momentlong circumference  
  
Not knowing whether we lay on land or sea  
Trapped in the beach’s mystery  
I was anxious, frightened even  
Knew not of any courage in me,  
To steal what was not mine and yet was all I could see around me  
  
Sand, Water, The Sky, The Birds,    
Hunger.   
I was hungry.  
I looked at the blue, gentle sea and murmured  
I have nothing to offer  
The ocean swelled up, rising tide, drawing its water in,  
I felt a cloud cover my eyes, repelling Helios’ fiery rage.  
And for a mere second the water stood still;   
the hourglass got turned,  
The waves they rushed jubilant and the water sprites came leaping, eager   
to continue playing their game along Gaia’s shores   
Rolling dollars of sand out of pennies, filling up the sea’s treasury   
    
And with their song of bubbles, drew us in in want of Odysseus’ deceit,  
For I was polymorphing within the sea’s gather  
Not merely a land-dweller, with my sandy skin  
Both outside and within  
An ocean rumbles  
Not a melody of bells serene  
Rather the slither of water as it sheds its sandy skin  
On the journey back into the sea  
  
But not too soon for there comes another  
Dampened thud  
My footprint on sand turns into a pool of sprites  
And for a second they bubble there, perfectly circular,  
Yet in another second, they initiate their return  
Stealing my steps away and my time  
  
For these sprites aren’t devotees of the ocean  
But those of Time  
Always suppliant with its essence yet  
Forever famished for mine  
  
The myth of Chronos persists perpetually  
No god are safe from his hollow appetite  
Not the Greeks having already departed our world for thousands of years  
Neither Vishnu, while still around, he recedes rapidly like the hairline of Grey-haired *vaishnavs*  
For gods just like words are made of this Earth  
Stubborn and unwieldy  
Rocks on the sea never last, no matter how igneous they be  
The earth turns once  
But the ocean sways eternally  
Turns and turns the sandglasses  
Thud thud thud  
*Kala*’s damru invoking endless destruction  
  
I look up to the sun, the clouds having cleared  
And at my feet  
The anxiety returns  
For now i have stepped off the horizon  
Where lands end and water begins  
Crashing waves  
I end, you begin  
  
Yes, for this is my metamorphosis, the transformation of the person within  
From I to You  
Me to thee  
I yearn to be one again  
Molt away this sandy exterior and give way to the surging ocean  
That rises without and within
